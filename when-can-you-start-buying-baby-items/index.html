Gender the majority of parents will wait until around 18 weeks before they start purchasing the larger items. I just bought a couple of little outfits first and then all the big stuff during 3rd trimester. You should wait until you are between 13 and 20 weeks pregnant (after the first trimester) to start buying baby stuff so that you can find out your baby’s gender and decide whether or not you will have a baby shower or other events. That’s because it’s usually not safe to buy anything for your unborn child during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
