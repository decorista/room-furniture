Childcare shakeup neglects family day care workers, but we can learn From theconversation.com
On an average 26% of employees in any organization require the facility of day care centers for their children, otherwise they would consider leaving their jobs. When companies provide child care, employee absences decrease by up to 30 percent and job turnover declines by as much as 60 percent. Implementing these measures will encourage employees to stick with your company as they age because they know you care about their family’s future. Without it, employees with young children may reduce their hours and productivity or leave the workforce altogether.
