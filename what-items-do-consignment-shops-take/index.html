However, before you go into consignment, you should take note of the following: It should specify how much your property will sell for, how long the shop, called the consignee, has to sell it, how much you and the shop get out of the sale, and how long the shop has to pay you after the sale. The percentage share of the retailer ranges from 25 to 50 percent, depending on the store and the type of merchandise. Usually the seller is charged between 25 percent and 60 percent commission so that the store can make a profit.
