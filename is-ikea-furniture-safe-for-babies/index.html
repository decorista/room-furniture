Baby Furniture IKEA From ikea.com
From the moment babies come into the world, they are using their senses to make sense of it. Ikea has a bad reputation just from it being almost a meme at this point, but the furniture is fine. For ikea, their baby cribs have a dimension of 27 1/2 x 52 inches, thus, meeting the general standard size for baby cribs. Having a safe crib and mattress means nothing if they don�t fit well together.
