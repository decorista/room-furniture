For new walkers, it is a whole different ball game for them to walk. Generally, babies and crawlers don’t get much use out of their shoes, partially because their feet grow so fast, but also because they can’t walk or run around so much as older kids. The softness of the sole allows the child’s foot to move freely and without restriction so they can flex their feet as needed, allowing them to function as nature intended, as if they are barefoot. Shoes are not necessary to be worn for ankle or arch support.
