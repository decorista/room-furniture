Baby Checklist 56 Baby Essentials Baby checklist, Baby registry From pinterest.com
However, if you come across a cute onesie that you simply can’t pass up, there’s no harm in purchasing certain items for your kid while you’re still pregnant. While deciding when you can start to buy baby stuff, here’s my best advice: There is no ‘right’ answer to when you should start buying baby stuff. You should wait until you are between 13 and 20 weeks pregnant (after the first trimester) to start buying baby stuff so that you can find out your baby’s gender and decide whether or not you will have a baby shower or other events.
