There can be a number of reasons behind tooth discoloration in toddlers. If a milk tooth receives a hard knock, then it may discolour and start to turn grey, yellow or black in colour. Furthermore, a diet high in sugary foods and drinks can increase the risk of tooth decay, which can present itself as dark or brown patches. If your child falls or suffers a blow that damages a tooth, the blood vessels inside the tooth may break and make teeth appear yellow, brown, gray, or black.
