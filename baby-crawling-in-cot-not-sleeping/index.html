Why my baby won’t sleep in crib/cot? The very act of putting a baby down, into the cot or crib, causes their falling reflex to trigger, startling them awake because of the presence of imminent danger (falling). Been reading a few posts on this recently and was fairly sure i had a while to go until this affected me.</p>

An old trick when a baby falls asleep in your arms is to get them to hold/grip your finger as they are dozing. Help them bend their knees to reach the toy.</p>

When i put her down she rolls onto her tummy, starts crawling around the cot and then gets legs stuck through the bars and wails! She is ok for most of the night (probably as she is so tired from not sleeping in the day!) but normally once a night she does the crawling, getting stuck and wailing thing. Well no, with crawling comes sitting up in the cot.</p>
