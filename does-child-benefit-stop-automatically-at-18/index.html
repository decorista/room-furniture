This happened to my eldest daughter in september 2015 (birthday 21st sep). Child benefit usually stops on 31st august following a child�s 18th birthday. If your child continues in approved education child benefit will stop. Your child benefit stops on 31 august on or after your child’s 16th birthday if they leave education or training.

<p>This happened to my eldest daughter in september 2015 (birthday 21st sep). Child tax credit is also being phased out, unless your child turns 18 or. Child benefit stops when the extension period ends or when your child turns 18, whichever comes first. .</p>
<h3 id="a-young-person-must-be-accepted-onto-an-approved-course-or-training-before-their-19th-birthday-to-be-eligible">A Young Person Must Be Accepted Onto An Approved Course Or Training Before Their 19Th Birthday To Be Eligible.</h3><p>The simple answer regarding most teenagers is yes! To get the child benefit extension your child must not be working more than 23 hours a week and you must apply within three months of them leaving education or training. That can happen either on, or soon after your child has had their 16th birthday. Does child benefit automatically stop at 18?</p>

<h3 id="does-child-benefit-stop-automatically-at-18">Does Child Benefit Stop Automatically At 18?</h3><p>Child benefit stops when the extension period ends or when your child turns 18, whichever comes first. If your child is 18 on the first day of the quarter, you will not receive any child benefit for that quarter. Getting paid if you were eligible for child benefit before hmrc got your claim form, your claim will be automatically. To get the child benefit extension your child must not be working more than 23 hours a week and you must apply within three months of them leaving education or training.</p>
<h3 id="yeah-it039s-always-the-august-after-their-18th">Yeah It�s Always The August After Their 18Th.</h3><p>Does child benefit automatically stop at 18? Child benefit usually stops on 31st august following a child�s 18th birthday. Chb will end at 16 and it will stop on the 31st of august.
